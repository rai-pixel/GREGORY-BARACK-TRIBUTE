    Biography
  </h2>
   <p> He joined the Army after college, and when most of his peers were taking office jobs, he went to infantry school, then airborne school, then Ranger school. He was a combat veteran.Many cannot weather the high demands of soldiering, not for long, but Greg did it for thirty years, in the jungles of Panama and many other countries. Much of his work was top secret and will never be known, but we know Greg did it well, as he honorably retired a full-bird Colonel.But his life of service did not end there. When he finally had a chance to join the ranks of his peers in the civilian world and to apply his hard earned skills to get a high paying job in the corporate world, he opted instead to be a teacher, a high school ROTC instructor, because he believed deeply that all hope lay in our nationâ€™s children and their education </p>
